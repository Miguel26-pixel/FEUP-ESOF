# Milestone 1

## Release

This version is released under [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC09T2/releases/tag/v0.1).

## Retrospective Meeting

### What went well

The project had a meaningful progress, providing the basic features of viewing alerts and points of interests information.

In this iteration, the team used mock controllers to simulate the fetching of data, so we started implementing the most important views without having a backend running.

### What should we do differently

Something lacking in this iteration was the tests. Due to the lack of time and also some inexperience of working with this new technology, we did not have time to add tests to the project. We should do small increments of the product along side with tests, from the beggining.

### What still puzzles the team

It's a new language, so it was difficult to do the issues at the begginning. Also, it was diffuclt to setup flutter with the right version.

# Milestone 2

## Release

This version is released under [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC09T2/releases/tag/v0.2).

## Retrospective Meeting

### What went well

The project had meaningful progress, having the foundation to have a fully working app.

In this iteration we implemented a fully working API and added a way of creating spontaneous alerts.

### What should we do differently

We should've not left reviews to the end of the iteration, just before the release, since there were a lot of things to review, creating a delay.

There's still the need to create more tests and do them right from the start of the development of the feature.

### What still puzzles the team

State management is sometimes confusing, leading to weird bugs in the app that take a long time to get fixed.

# Milestone 3

## Release

This version is released under [here](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/3LEIC09T2/releases/tag/v1.0).

## Retrospective Meeting

### What went well

The project had a breaktrough, implementing the remaining features required to have a finished and functional MVP.

In this iteration we added aditional important features and replaced all of the mock controllers with the API.

In this iteration the features were reviewed and merged before the end of the iteration.

### What should we do differently

We should've writen more tests to guarantee the robustness of the app.

### What still puzzles the team

We had some difficulties understanding some particularities of gherkin tests.
