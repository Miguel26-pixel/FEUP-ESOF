## Project Vision

The Live@UP app is a service that aims to simplify the life of every student of the University of Porto who constantly uses university services. Every day, students can't make an informed choice on where and when to go to a specific place, such as the canteen, coffee machine or the library. Various unpredictable factors influence this choice, and students don't have immediate access to these problems. 

Our product proposes to address these problems by providing a collaborative platform for the student community with the ability to warn others about the availability of certain places or other relevant events. It will help the student make an informed choice on where and when to go. With this, students won't be losing any more time looking for a place to study or lunch, helping them plan their life schedule to the minute!
